This period lasted about a week or two for me :-|

Don't give up. Keep trying.

You need to set `timeoutlen` to a large value (5000 i.e. 5 s).

You need to use visual selection to for performing the operations (e.g.: `d`, `y`)

You rely undo `u` and <kbd>Ctrl o</kbd> to be back on your feed.

Limit the number of plugin that you install to the list of basic plugins.
Read the [Beginner Plugins](beginnerplugins.md) section.
