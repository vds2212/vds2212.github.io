# Beginner Plugins

The goal of this paragraph is to list a number of plugins for beginners.

There focus is to:
- Make Vim easier to use (more intuitive).
- Perform some basic editor task more intuitively


## Plugin-Manager

A plugin manager to install the plugins.

## Colorscheme


Look and feel is so important to me. I need that the editor looks good.

You can use the [VimColorSchemes](https://vimcolorschemes.com/) to help you finding a color scheme that fit your taste
and that is mature enough.

[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) [The most popular one]

## [Traces](https://github.com/markonm/traces.vim)

Visualize the result of the substitution while you are typing it.
It helps you identifying the mistakes you do when using the regular expression.


## [Vim-Visual-Star-Search](https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-visual-star-search)

Extend the `*` search to the visual selection.
Useful if you need to search text containing spaces or punctuation.


## [Vim-HighlightedYank](https://github.com/machakann/vim-highlightedyank)

Shortly highlight the text you just yank (copy).
It gives you confidence to yank without first selecting.


### Fuzzy Finding

Helps you to find file and to switch buffers.

- [Vim-Clap](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap) [my favorite on Windows]
