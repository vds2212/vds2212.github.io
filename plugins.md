# Plugins

Plugin choice depends on your need and taste.

There are a lot of plugins [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/) mention about 19 thousand. I follow about 700.

In the [Categories](#categories) list I have tried to identify the needs that have gather a enough of attention such that one project get more than two thousand stars on github (as of 31/10/2023).

I have restricted the list to the plugins that supports both Vim and Neovim.

It is based on months of collecting plugins via blogs but also via plugin directories:
- [vimawesome](https://vimawesome.com/)
- [vimcolorscheme](https://vimcolorschemes.com/)
- [neovimcraft](https://neovimcraft.com/)
- [trending Neovim plugins](https://dotfyle.com/neovim/plugins/trending)

It does not reflect my personal choice although I use or I have tested a fair amount of these.

Remark: There are numerous plugins that I like and use very often and that are not listed because the corresponding need did reach the two thousand target that I have fixed 

In the [Recommendations](#recommendations) list I have added a number that doesn't reach the two thousand threshold but that I consider very useful.
